        "While methane observing systems are proliferating there remain serious gaps in terms of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> systems and analytic frameworks that can fully exploit them. Through our collective exposure to remote-sensing based methane research and applied science we assess that currently there is no information system technology that can address the improvements in <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis latency, discoverability, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> fusion and on-demand analytics required by the research community and public and private sector decision makers. We propose to develop a Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) that can help address one of the more persistent challenges in Earth System Science: understanding the causes for the changing atmospheric growth rate of methane. M2AF will lay the foundation for extending existing methane analysis systems beyond their current experimental states, reduce latency and cost of methane <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis and improve accessibility by researchers and decision makers. To meet these needs M2AF will advance and uniquely bring together multiple observational <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets, models and analysis methods to estimate methane fluxes across three key, overlapping spatial scales in order to disentangle confounding processes: 1) global to regional scale, 2) regional to local scale, and 3) facility (point source scale). M2AF will offer workflow optimization and management tools to improve automation, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> search and discovery tools for improved access to intermediate and final products, as well as on-demand analytics and web- based tools for interacting with diverse <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets.

These endeavors will require the ability to precisely reconfigure satellites swarms to specifications generated on the fly according to scientific priorities. Crucial to reconfiguring swarms is the ability to maneuver individual satellites between prespecified start and end positions in a fixed amount of time.However, there is no consensus solution on how to do these single satellite maneuvers fuel-efficiently in the general case. Consider the position of a single satellite in the swarms Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) reference frame relative to the swarms reference orbit.  For specific single satellite transition scenarios, such as transferring the satellite between LVLH passive reference orbits (PROs) with minimal thrust expenditure in the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) linearized orbit dynamics system, provably optimal algorithms have been developed. But these provably optimal algorithms fail to generalize in a multitude of ways. They fail to generalize to arbitrary start and end states in the LVLH frame, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamical models such as those including J2 and drag terms, they cannot handle more detailed models of thrusters and satellite pose, and cannot account for more complex optimization criteria which balance the needs of scientific instruments with fuel efficiency and timeliness.",

AFIDS forked in 2000 to focus on Earth orbital image co-registration in support of the NASA Earth Sciences program. Today, the effort is to re-integrate AFIDS back into VICAR and release it through the VICAR Open Source program. -AFIDS brings the concept of \"georeferenced map images\" to VICAR through the AFIDS \"VicarGT\" format (a compatible version of the industry standard \"GeoTIFF\" format). - AFIDS provides the ability to Ortho-Rectify and Co-Register orbital satellite imagery (using automated and customizable software).- AFIDS provides the image processing tools to perform scientific analysis and research of co-registered imagery (for example: Precision Change Detection).- AFIDS is rooted in Earth Science (supporting MISR, MAIA, CloudSat, EMIT, ECOSTRESS, OCO2, more), but also provides mapping support for Mars and Planetary orbital datasets (e.g., Mars Nest; AFIDS Mosaicking).AFIDS is a library collection of 200+ vicar-based programs and scripts, but also relies upon JPL and external 3rd party libraries including GDAL, GeoTIFF, Python, JPL GEOCAL, NASA NAIF/SPICE, and a variety of global databases.",

        "ADOPT (abbr. Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining/ machine learning algorithm that processes large volumes of time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors.The ADOPT algorithm is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of  flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of  flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of  flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis.While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",

        "<p>Developers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center have developed a software toolkit--dubbed Chapter 10 Tools--that is capable of reading <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various onboard digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard but use differing interpretations of that standard.</p><p>The toolkit reads <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, displays the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, and even identifies and corrects errors. Ultimately, it produces a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file that can be successfully processed post-flight.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools was developed in response to ongoing challenges researchers at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range faced when attempting to process <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various vendors' digital recorders. As Chapter 10 experienced rapid growth as a technology standard for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, many digital recorder vendors began interpreting the standard differently--resulting in errors and variations (sometimes even between one vendor's different firmware versions of the same recorder). While some errors could be identified with Chapter 10 validation software, the type of error was not always apparent, making fixes problematic. These errors and variations can prevent software from reading and processing the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file, thereby effectively making the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> unavailable.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools eliminates these challenges with a flexible software toolkit that gives users visibility into the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file's individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets, allowing for both manual and automatic correction of errors. An additional Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) editor offers the ability to modify and add details to the TMATS file. Because aircraft personnel typically only include enough information in the TMATS portion of the Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file to allow for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, this leaves a gap in ground personnel's ability to process that <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. So, the TMATS editor enables error correction and provides the ability to add the additional information needed to process the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is now in widespread use at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.</p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Diagnostic: Accurately identifies errors and variations in various Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files, as well as the error type</p><p> * Flexible: Offers a flexible architecture enabling visibility into individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets</p><p> * Easy to use: Autocorrects most errors, and makes manual error identification and correction simple and streamlined</p><p>APPLICATIONS</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is ideal for:</p><p> * NASA flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> processors needing to reconcile <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> between varying flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recorders</p><p> * Software developers looking to integrate error identification and correction capabilities into their Chapter 10 toolkits</p>",

        "Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is an optical technique for measuring density gradients in flow fields, in quiescent air or even liquids. In traditional BOS, images of a speckled target are recorded using an electronic camera first at quiescent conditions (reference image) and then with the flow or density gradient causing phenomena initiated ('wind on' image). Small changes in the image of the speckled target caused by optical aberrations along the line-of-sight can be measured by cross-correlating the reference image with the 'wind on' image, yielding a map of the density gradients along the imaged path. The size of the speckles and their uniformity of illumination are critical to the success and sensitivity of the technique. BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> are recorded in real time using electronic CCD type cameras. However, processing and/or analysis of the traditional BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> is performed off-line after the test/experiment is completed.Advances in computer processing hardware enables the implementation of real-time processing and display of the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Two different approaches to implementing the real-time BOS (RT-BOS) processing capability have been implemented. First, a traditional multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) based approach using scheduled parallel threads is used to build a RT-BOS processing engine. In the second approach, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) approach is used to construct a RT-BOS processing engine. Generally, high-core count CPU processors can provide a useful processing rate for RT-BOS.  However, the GPU based approach exceeds the processing capability of the CPU approach, at a fraction of the cost. The GPU approach places no restrictions on the host PC processing capability, except that it be capable of acquiring the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> from the camera in real-time.",

The GPM FSW monitors the health of  most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.  The GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power,  and the pointing of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS.   The GPM FSW uses the propulsion system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion.  The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform \"yaw maneuvers\" to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees.The GPM FSW uses Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission use.",

To ensure the quality of the metadata, the CMR system contains a tool called the Metadata Management Tool (MMT) which enables metadata providers to develop standards-compliant, high-quality metadata and have that metadata scored against quality standards as well as providing a means to manage access to that metadata.  CMR is designed to:- Serve as a middleware replacement for the EOS Clearing House (ECHO) and Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)s backend. - Handle metadata at the Concept level including: Collections, Granules, Visualizations, Parameters, Documentation, Services, and more.manage hundreds of millions of metadata records; making them available through high performance, standards compliant, temporal, spatial, and faceted search.- Incorporate both human and machine metadata assessment features that work to ensure the highest quality metadata possible.",

As various technologies have advanced, however, both the rate and efficiency with which <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> can be effectively transferred have grown incredibly quickly.  This has left existing craft unable to utilize more than a small fraction of available capacity.  Further, to date, most known implementations of DTN have been designed to operate on the spacecraft themselves.The innovation, in this case, is a software prototype called High-speed DTN (or HDTN).  HDTN takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to offer substantial improvement on latency and throughput with respect to DTN implementations that exist today.  Specifically, our implementation maintains compatibility with existing implementations of DTN that conform to IETF RFC 5050, while simultaneously defining a new <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format that is better suited to higher-rate operation in many cases.  It defines and adopts a massively parallel, pipelined, and message-oriented architecture, which allows the system to scale gracefully as the resources available to the system increase.

Both the TSPT and PPET use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite multi-spectral <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> as a default, but each software package is easily modifiable and could be used with any high-temporal-rate remote sensing system that is capable of producing vegetation indices.Unlike other known plant phenological parameter estimation software, the PPET produces not only common phenological parameters but also real-time and custom parameters without a priori assumptions about the shape of the phenological cycle. Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle.  They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.MATLAB, MATLAB Runtime Library and ERDAS IMAGINE are required to run the software.",

        "PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion. These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular aerospace) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models. ",

        "An automated Spatial Resolution Verification Tool (SRVT) was developed to rapidly determine the spatial resolution characteristics of remotely sensed aerial and satellite imagery. Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).Developed using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.The SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.",

        "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential to provide meaningful and reliable predictions of real-world system performance. One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance computing. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7.To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMC class and a call to the sample() method.

        "Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) is a three-dimensional solid mechanics code that provides a parallel implementation of the finite element method (FEM). Generally speaking, the FEM is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, ScIFEN uses the FEM to solve the PDEs that govern the motion and deformation of solid materials under the action of external loads. Thus, ScIFEN uses input information describing a solid's geometry, material properties, applied forces, etc. to compute and return the resulting mechanical response (e.g. displacements, stresses, etc.). ScIFEN is a parallel code written in C++ and designed to scale to large problems that can be run on supercomputers across many processors. This scalability and efficiency is enabled through the utilization of several open-source high performance computing libraries. The most heavily used libraries include: 1) Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) for the parallel solution of linear/non-linear systems of equations, 2) Hierarchical <span class=\"highlight\">Data</span> Format (HDF5) for general parallel input/output, and 3) Mesh Orientated Database (MOAB) for storage and managing finite element mesh <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in parallel. ScIFEN includes several standard linear and non-linear material models including linear elastic isotropic, linear hardening plasticity, and crystal plasticity models. It supports various applied loadings including prescribed displacements and forces, surface tractions and pressures, and body forces.

The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. This innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.</p><p>Developed to calculate the number of operational life flights for B-52B pylon hooks, the program and underlying theories can be applied to estimate the service life of any critical structural component. </p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Reliable: Predicts operational flight life of critical aerostructural components</p><p> * Accurate: Considers a comprehensive suite of test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> by counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, including secondary mini-amplitude half-cycles that do not cross mean stress lines</p><p> * Customized: Identifies potential structural problem areas and calculates the number of safe flights an aerostructure can make based on its particular duty cycle</p><p> * Economical: Saves monetary costs associated with loss of expensive equipment due to component failures</p><p> * Adaptable: Offers applicability to other industries, with modifications to the input model</p><p>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</p><p> * Spacecraft</p><p> * Aircraft</p><p> * Ships</p><p> * Oil rigs</p><p> * Windmills </p><p> * Bridges</p><p> * Oscillating industrial equipment used in mines and quarries</p><p>HOW IT WORKS</p><p>The Half-Cycle Crack Growth Computer Program is a powerful and practical tool for visualizing crack growth curves associated with critical stress points. It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an aircraft can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p><p>To obtain baseline <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p><p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight. The crack growth curves provided the visual knowledge that taxiing, takeoff, drop/landing, and sometimes gusts induced a major portion of the total crack growth per operation.</p><p>Written in the C programming language, the program can be adapted for use in other industries by modifying the input model (i.e., <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format load spectrum files) for the most expensive and mission critical components.</p><p>WHY IT IS BETTER</p><p>The program examines test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in a much more detailed fashion than other fatigue crack growth modeling software, counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, so it is able to make better predictions about component life. By improving fatigue and failure predictions, the software provides safer flights and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, these predictions allow engineers to determine the critical points during operation that the majority of stress is placed on a particular component, which could allow for better component design that takes those specific forces into account.</p>",

Traditional camera-based localization methods fail when the robot is moving fast (motion blur) or when the robot is in very dark or bright environments (over/undersaturated pixels). An event camera is a new type of imaging sensor that reports changes in pixel brightness per pixel independently and asynchronously with microsecond resolution and overcomes both of these problems. However, the asynchronous nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> is a challenge for traditional \"synchronous\" pipelines that receive a full image at a time.

This Sargassum spp. detection is an extended form of Hus approach to derive a floating algae index (FAI), which is defined as the difference between the reflectance at the near infrared band (NIR, 859 nm) (vegetation red edge) and the linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (SWIR, 1240 or 1640 nm). The Hus algorithm was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus algorithm derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our algorithm only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid.  One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m.   To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total  number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering algorithm or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The  focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico.  The identification is followed up by a routine to map their location inside the Hybrid  Coordinate Ocean Model MODEL (HYCOM) surface grid.

For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of aircraft design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing.

Although subsequent studies showed the model to be reasonably accurate for such applications, modifications to the sunspot number (SSN) classification system and a large number of new highprecision measurements suggested the need to develop an improved and more capable model. The new BON2020 model relies on daily integral flux from the Advanced Composition Explorer Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/CRIS) to describe solar activity.

This paper defines the PeTaL concept and workflow. Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. The primary objective of this paper is to expand the domain of inquiry for human processes that seek to model those that are, were or could be found in nature with examples that relate to the field of aerospace and to spur development of tools that can work together to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. Specifically specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology are proposed in conjunction with artificial evolution. Blockchain technology may be vital in allowing open source design tools such as PeTaL to democratize design and yet protect intellectual property. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem. Tools include text classification, thesaurus, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> visualization, and analysis. Applications of PeTaL include guiding human space exploration, understanding human and geological history, and discovering new or extinct life.",

        "DTN Marshall Enterprise is a fully compliant CCSDS Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) router that has been used to conduct International Space Station (ISS) payload operations for many years. Communications in space are characterized by their disrupted, wireless nature. Whether due to occultation, scheduling, cost or solar flares, spacecraft must handle interruptions in connectivity and <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> losses. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) using the bundle protocol (BP) can maximize the efficient use of links to and among spacecraft. As part of NASAs efforts to deploy DTN in space, the HOSC developed a general purpose DTN router based on the SourceForge DTN2 version 6 reference code and reinvented a previously develop capability called the External Router. This allows non-network cognizant operators to manage the ground gateway as though it were another piece of the ground system without perturbing its actual specifications. The HOSC has deployed their implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) to payloads on the International Space Station (ISS).The current request is to export and make available for technology transfer the current DTNME implementation. It is also desirable for it to reside on github.com/NASA/DTNME. DTNME implemented DTN protocols as primarily defined by RFC 5050 and several other RFCs. This was also used by the HOSC to verify a new CCSDS standard (Bundle Protocol Specification CCSDS 734.2-B-1) that is used in various programs.  The standard or the next generation is now being targeted for Gateway. After successfully using it operationally, we have accumulated a new patch set. The combined implementation is what we would like to release as DTNME v0.1. DTN2 software updates were originally released to SourceForge.net under NTR# 1428003694. This was a patch update that incorporated functionality of the CCSDS standard and pre-operational generic features used on the ISS.",

        "Activity Planning with Resources for the Exploration of Space (APRES) is a mixed-initiative mission planning system for ground operations. APRES has a web-based user interface that is integrated with the Open-source Mission Control Technologies (OpenMCT) system and includes a plan editor, a timeline plan display, a temporal constraint editor, display of the state and numeric chronicles, and a mixed-initiative violation resolution manager. Automation support is supplied by the APRES Service, which includes components that provide the following capabilities:(1) plan simulation, which determines the state and numeric chronicles (values of the model variables over time) and determines when \"processes\" are triggered and terminated based on world states in the execution trace, (2) violation detection of constraints and flight rules encoded in the domain model, as well as of user-created temporal constraints, (3) violation resolution suggestions as to how to fix the plan's violations. The user controls when and how to utilize the automation support.The APRES Service components are based on the Action Notation Modeling Language (ANML) which is a highly expressive, powerful language for specification of domain models. ANML enables the specification of an extensive variety of flight rules and resource usage (e.g., one can represent continuous effects).  In addition to action definitions, ANML models can include definitions of \"processes\", which are not under the control of the agent or human planner, e.g., the operation of a survival heater that is powered on and off based on the current temperature. Integrated with the APRES system is a web-based ANML Editor for creating, editing, and debugging domain models.  The ANML Editor interacts with the ANML Parser to detect errors and interacts with the APRES <span class=\"highlight\">Data</span> Store for file management.",

        "<p>This easy-to-use open source MATLAB&#174;- based software was first developed to give X-56A aircraft engineers a modeling tool to understand aeroservoelasticity. EZASE now introduces students and practicing engineers to aeroservoelastic phenomena in flexible structures. Useful for analysis and control design of flutter or gust-load alleviation, EZASE is applicable to ground vibration, cantilever loading, and wind tunnel testing.</p><p>This finite element modeling and simulation tool for aeroservoelastic analysis of rectangular wings with trailing-edge control surfaces includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m). The tutorial uses such elements as 12 degree-of-freedom (DOF) plates and 6 DOF beams. An aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together, the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies, such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, and wind tunnel testing. </p><p>The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces, or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots (velocity versus g loads) determined using the K-method are also included.</p><p>The code is commented for graduate and undergraduate students who want to know the basic concepts of medium-fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. (Not all methods are coded to industry standards, but it is useful for basic understanding.) All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications--one focusing on verification and validation (V&V) with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>--are also included.</p><p>FEATURES</p><p>* Produces models in seconds</p><p> * Includes tutorial and references</p><p> * Makes videos for intuitive understanding of gust/flutter dynamics</p><p> * Enables easy modification of a full range of parameters</p><p>MATLAB is a registered trademark of The Mathworks, Inc.</p>",

        "While methane observing systems are proliferating there remain serious gaps in terms of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> systems and analytic frameworks that can fully exploit them. Through our collective exposure to remote-sensing based methane research and applied science we assess that currently there is no information system technology that can address the improvements in <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis latency, discoverability, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> fusion and on-demand analytics required by the research community and public and private sector decision makers. We propose to develop a Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) that can help address one of the more persistent challenges in Earth System Science: understanding the causes for the changing atmospheric growth rate of methane. M2AF will lay the foundation for extending existing methane analysis systems beyond their current experimental states, reduce latency and cost of methane <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis and improve accessibility by researchers and decision makers. To meet these needs M2AF will advance and uniquely bring together multiple observational <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets, models and analysis methods to estimate methane fluxes across three key, overlapping spatial scales in order to disentangle confounding processes: 1) global to regional scale, 2) regional to local scale, and 3) facility (point source scale). M2AF will offer workflow optimization and management tools to improve automation, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> search and discovery tools for improved access to intermediate and final products, as well as on-demand analytics and web- based tools for interacting with diverse <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets.

ECCO state estimates are of particular significance to NASA because on their own, all satellite observations, although global in coverage, remain sparse in space and time relative to the inherent scales of ocean variability, and are blind to the oceans interior. With increased streams of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> at better spatial resolution the scientific utility of the product is increasingly limited by 1) the inability to automate observing network ingestion and update in a rapid, robust manner, and 2) the lack of capabilities to search, and perform efficient online <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis. ECCO-Cloud is a NASA Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth System Science (ACCESS) project. Its goals are to tackle the two limitations by leveraging serverless cloud-based solution to automate product generation and to establish a cloud-based analytics center for the ECCO community for fast access and interactive analysis using prior NASA AIST-funded technology, the Apache Science <span class=\"highlight\">Data</span> Analytics Platform (https://sdap.apache.org).",

        "Satellite swarms will be an integral tool for many future space-based scientific endeavors, including space-based interferometry. These endeavors will require the ability to precisely reconfigure satellites swarms to specifications generated on the fly according to scientific priorities. Crucial to reconfiguring swarms is the ability to maneuver individual satellites between prespecified start and end positions in a fixed amount of time.However, there is no consensus solution on how to do these single satellite maneuvers fuel-efficiently in the general case. Consider the position of a single satellite in the swarms Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) reference frame relative to the swarms reference orbit.  For specific single satellite transition scenarios, such as transferring the satellite between LVLH passive reference orbits (PROs) with minimal thrust expenditure in the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) linearized orbit dynamics system, provably optimal algorithms have been developed. But these provably optimal algorithms fail to generalize in a multitude of ways. They fail to generalize to arbitrary start and end states in the LVLH frame, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamical models such as those including J2 and drag terms, they cannot handle more detailed models of thrusters and satellite pose, and cannot account for more complex optimization criteria which balance the needs of scientific instruments with fuel efficiency and timeliness.",

        "ADOPT (abbr. Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining/ machine learning algorithm that processes large volumes of time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors.The ADOPT algorithm is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of  flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of  flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of  flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis.While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",

When messages arrive, they are decoded, the contents are displayed to the screen, sorted by topic, and saved internally.  Telemetry messages can be saved to binary files for further processing.Also included are several utility python scripts.  Two such scripts perform the command sending and telemetry decoding functionality of the GUI.  The third reads in the saved telemetry <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files and converts the messages into a CSV format which can be loaded in an Excel type program.",

        "<p>Developers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center have developed a software toolkit--dubbed Chapter 10 Tools--that is capable of reading <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various onboard digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard but use differing interpretations of that standard.</p><p>The toolkit reads <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, displays the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, and even identifies and corrects errors. Ultimately, it produces a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file that can be successfully processed post-flight.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools was developed in response to ongoing challenges researchers at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range faced when attempting to process <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various vendors' digital recorders. As Chapter 10 experienced rapid growth as a technology standard for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, many digital recorder vendors began interpreting the standard differently--resulting in errors and variations (sometimes even between one vendor's different firmware versions of the same recorder). While some errors could be identified with Chapter 10 validation software, the type of error was not always apparent, making fixes problematic. These errors and variations can prevent software from reading and processing the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file, thereby effectively making the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> unavailable.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools eliminates these challenges with a flexible software toolkit that gives users visibility into the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file's individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets, allowing for both manual and automatic correction of errors. An additional Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) editor offers the ability to modify and add details to the TMATS file. Because aircraft personnel typically only include enough information in the TMATS portion of the Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file to allow for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, this leaves a gap in ground personnel's ability to process that <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. So, the TMATS editor enables error correction and provides the ability to add the additional information needed to process the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is now in widespread use at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.</p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Diagnostic: Accurately identifies errors and variations in various Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files, as well as the error type</p><p> * Flexible: Offers a flexible architecture enabling visibility into individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets</p><p> * Easy to use: Autocorrects most errors, and makes manual error identification and correction simple and streamlined</p><p>APPLICATIONS</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is ideal for:</p><p> * NASA flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> processors needing to reconcile <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> between varying flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recorders</p><p> * Software developers looking to integrate error identification and correction capabilities into their Chapter 10 toolkits</p>",

CAPE does NOT include any of the supported CFD solvers, which must be acquired separately.This tool is distributed as a Python package, which makes it easy to install. Within NASA, the CAPE package has an extensive history with large CFD run matrices and many terabytes of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Examples in support of the Space Launch System Program include studies separately involving about 25,000 Cart3D cases, 1500 OVERFLOW cases, and 15,000 FUN3D cases.",

        "Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is an optical technique for measuring density gradients in flow fields, in quiescent air or even liquids. In traditional BOS, images of a speckled target are recorded using an electronic camera first at quiescent conditions (reference image) and then with the flow or density gradient causing phenomena initiated ('wind on' image). Small changes in the image of the speckled target caused by optical aberrations along the line-of-sight can be measured by cross-correlating the reference image with the 'wind on' image, yielding a map of the density gradients along the imaged path. The size of the speckles and their uniformity of illumination are critical to the success and sensitivity of the technique. BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> are recorded in real time using electronic CCD type cameras. However, processing and/or analysis of the traditional BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> is performed off-line after the test/experiment is completed.Advances in computer processing hardware enables the implementation of real-time processing and display of the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Two different approaches to implementing the real-time BOS (RT-BOS) processing capability have been implemented. First, a traditional multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) based approach using scheduled parallel threads is used to build a RT-BOS processing engine. In the second approach, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) approach is used to construct a RT-BOS processing engine. Generally, high-core count CPU processors can provide a useful processing rate for RT-BOS.  However, the GPU based approach exceeds the processing capability of the CPU approach, at a fraction of the cost. The GPU approach places no restrictions on the host PC processing capability, except that it be capable of acquiring the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> from the camera in real-time.",

Further, to date, most known implementations of DTN have been designed to operate on the spacecraft themselves.The innovation, in this case, is a software prototype called High-speed DTN (or HDTN).  HDTN takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to offer substantial improvement on latency and throughput with respect to DTN implementations that exist today.  Specifically, our implementation maintains compatibility with existing implementations of DTN that conform to IETF RFC 5050, while simultaneously defining a new <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format that is better suited to higher-rate operation in many cases.  It defines and adopts a massively parallel, pipelined, and message-oriented architecture, which allows the system to scale gracefully as the resources available to the system increase.

Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle.  They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.MATLAB, MATLAB Runtime Library and ERDAS IMAGINE are required to run the software.",

        "PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion. These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular aerospace) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models. ",

Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).Developed using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.The SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.",

        "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential to provide meaningful and reliable predictions of real-world system performance. One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance computing. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7.To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMC class and a call to the sample() method.

        "Scalable Implementation of Finite Elements by NASA (ScIFEN) is a three-dimensional solid mechanics code that provides a parallel implementation of the finite element method (FEM). Generally speaking, the FEM is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, ScIFEN uses the FEM to solve the PDEs that govern the motion and deformation of solid materials under the action of external loads. Thus, ScIFEN uses input information describing a solid's geometry, material properties, applied forces, etc. to compute and return the resulting mechanical response (e.g. displacements, stresses, etc.). ScIFEN is a parallel code written in C++ and designed to scale to large problems that can be run on supercomputers across many processors. This scalability and efficiency is enabled through the utilization of several open-source high performance computing libraries. The most heavily used libraries include: 1) Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) for the parallel solution of linear/non-linear systems of equations, 2) Hierarchical <span class=\"highlight\">Data</span> Format (HDF5) for general parallel input/output, and 3) Mesh Orientated Database (MOAB) for storage and managing finite element mesh <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in parallel. ScIFEN includes several standard linear and non-linear material models including linear elastic isotropic, linear hardening plasticity, and crystal plasticity models. It supports various applied loadings including prescribed displacements and forces, surface tractions and pressures, and body forces.

        "Half-Cycle Crack Growth Predicts Operational Flight Life of Critical Aerostructural Components",
        "<p>This software program offers a reliable method for calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. This innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.</p><p>Developed to calculate the number of operational life flights for B-52B pylon hooks, the program and underlying theories can be applied to estimate the service life of any critical structural component. </p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Reliable: Predicts operational flight life of critical aerostructural components</p><p> * Accurate: Considers a comprehensive suite of test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> by counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, including secondary mini-amplitude half-cycles that do not cross mean stress lines</p><p> * Customized: Identifies potential structural problem areas and calculates the number of safe flights an aerostructure can make based on its particular duty cycle</p><p> * Economical: Saves monetary costs associated with loss of expensive equipment due to component failures</p><p> * Adaptable: Offers applicability to other industries, with modifications to the input model</p><p>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</p><p> * Spacecraft</p><p> * Aircraft</p><p> * Ships</p><p> * Oil rigs</p><p> * Windmills </p><p> * Bridges</p><p> * Oscillating industrial equipment used in mines and quarries</p><p>HOW IT WORKS</p><p>The Half-Cycle Crack Growth Computer Program is a powerful and practical tool for visualizing crack growth curves associated with critical stress points. It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an aircraft can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p><p>To obtain baseline <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p><p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight. The crack growth curves provided the visual knowledge that taxiing, takeoff, drop/landing, and sometimes gusts induced a major portion of the total crack growth per operation.</p><p>Written in the C programming language, the program can be adapted for use in other industries by modifying the input model (i.e., <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format load spectrum files) for the most expensive and mission critical components.</p><p>WHY IT IS BETTER</p><p>The program examines test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in a much more detailed fashion than other fatigue crack growth modeling software, counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, so it is able to make better predictions about component life. By improving fatigue and failure predictions, the software provides safer flights and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, these predictions allow engineers to determine the critical points during operation that the majority of stress is placed on a particular component, which could allow for better component design that takes those specific forces into account.</p>",

The Hus algorithm was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus algorithm derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our algorithm only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid.  One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m.   To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total  number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering algorithm or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The  focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico.  The identification is followed up by a routine to map their location inside the Hybrid  Coordinate Ocean Model MODEL (HYCOM) surface grid.

For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of aircraft design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing.

        "The objective of DejaVu is to verify the execution of a running system against a requirement formalized in a formal logic. The system will typically be a software system that has been instrumented to generate events as it executes. The event stream is then consumed by the DejaVu monitor, and checked against a formal specification. If the event stream violates the specification, an error message is generated. This technology can be used in two ways: online and offline. In the online case, it runs on board for example a rover as it operates, checking that what is happening on the rover is according to expectations formalized in the formal logic. If the expectations are not met, the DejaVu monitor will inform the software that it needs to correct behavior. Alternatively, DejaVu can be used to analyze log files produced by the monitored system. Such log files can be analyzed after the system has executed.Software program for analyzing execution traces generated by a running system, typically another program, here referred to as the Monitored System (MS). The MS must be instrumented to emit events as it executes. The emitted trace is consumed by the DejaVu monitor, which verifies it against a property (requirement) formalized in first-order past time temporal logic. The system is innovative in using BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) for storing <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> from the execution trace.",

        "The BadhwarO'Neill (BON) model has been used for some time to describe the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment encountered in deep space by astronauts and sensitive electronics. This package contains the BON2020 model. The previous version of the model, BON2014, was calibrated to available measurements to reduce model errors for particles and energies of significance to astronaut exposure. Although subsequent studies showed the model to be reasonably accurate for such applications, modifications to the sunspot number (SSN) classification system and a large number of new highprecision measurements suggested the need to develop an improved and more capable model. The new BON2020 model relies on daily integral flux from the Advanced Composition Explorer Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/CRIS) to describe solar activity. For time periods not covered by ACE/CRIS, the updated international SSN database is used. Parameters in the new model are calibrated to available <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, which include the new Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS02) and Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Lightnuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) highprecision measurements. It is found that the BON2020 model is a significant improvement over BON2014. Systematic bias associated with BON2014 has been removed. The average relative error of the BON2020 model compared to all available measurements is found to be <1%, and BON2020 is found to be within 15% of a large fraction of the available measurements (26,269 of 27,646  95%).",

The first one extracts average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years).  Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points.  The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red).The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level.  These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both.A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts.  These statistics include total pixel number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).",

        "The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL) is a tool and open source framework that uses artificial intelligence to aid in the systematic inquiry of biology for its application to human systems. This paper defines the PeTaL concept and workflow. Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. The primary objective of this paper is to expand the domain of inquiry for human processes that seek to model those that are, were or could be found in nature with examples that relate to the field of aerospace and to spur development of tools that can work together to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. Specifically specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology are proposed in conjunction with artificial evolution. Blockchain technology may be vital in allowing open source design tools such as PeTaL to democratize design and yet protect intellectual property. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem. Tools include text classification, thesaurus, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> visualization, and analysis. Applications of PeTaL include guiding human space exploration, understanding human and geological history, and discovering new or extinct life.",

        "DTN Marshall Enterprise is a fully compliant CCSDS Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) router that has been used to conduct International Space Station (ISS) payload operations for many years. Communications in space are characterized by their disrupted, wireless nature. Whether due to occultation, scheduling, cost or solar flares, spacecraft must handle interruptions in connectivity and <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> losses. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) using the bundle protocol (BP) can maximize the efficient use of links to and among spacecraft. As part of NASAs efforts to deploy DTN in space, the HOSC developed a general purpose DTN router based on the SourceForge DTN2 version 6 reference code and reinvented a previously develop capability called the External Router. This allows non-network cognizant operators to manage the ground gateway as though it were another piece of the ground system without perturbing its actual specifications. The HOSC has deployed their implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) to payloads on the International Space Station (ISS).The current request is to export and make available for technology transfer the current DTNME implementation. It is also desirable for it to reside on github.com/NASA/DTNME. DTNME implemented DTN protocols as primarily defined by RFC 5050 and several other RFCs. This was also used by the HOSC to verify a new CCSDS standard (Bundle Protocol Specification CCSDS 734.2-B-1) that is used in various programs.  The standard or the next generation is now being targeted for Gateway. After successfully using it operationally, we have accumulated a new patch set. The combined implementation is what we would like to release as DTNME v0.1. DTN2 software updates were originally released to SourceForge.net under NTR# 1428003694. This was a patch update that incorporated functionality of the CCSDS standard and pre-operational generic features used on the ISS.",

Automation support is supplied by the APRES Service, which includes components that provide the following capabilities:(1) plan simulation, which determines the state and numeric chronicles (values of the model variables over time) and determines when \"processes\" are triggered and terminated based on world states in the execution trace, (2) violation detection of constraints and flight rules encoded in the domain model, as well as of user-created temporal constraints, (3) violation resolution suggestions as to how to fix the plan's violations. The user controls when and how to utilize the automation support.The APRES Service components are based on the Action Notation Modeling Language (ANML) which is a highly expressive, powerful language for specification of domain models. ANML enables the specification of an extensive variety of flight rules and resource usage (e.g., one can represent continuous effects).  In addition to action definitions, ANML models can include definitions of \"processes\", which are not under the control of the agent or human planner, e.g., the operation of a survival heater that is powered on and off based on the current temperature. Integrated with the APRES system is a web-based ANML Editor for creating, editing, and debugging domain models.

The tutorial uses such elements as 12 degree-of-freedom (DOF) plates and 6 DOF beams. An aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together, the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies, such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, and wind tunnel testing. </p><p>The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces, or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots (velocity versus g loads) determined using the K-method are also included.</p><p>The code is commented for graduate and undergraduate students who want to know the basic concepts of medium-fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling.

Through our collective exposure to remote-sensing based methane research and applied science we assess that currently there is no information system technology that can address the improvements in <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis latency, discoverability, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> fusion and on-demand analytics required by the research community and public and private sector decision makers. We propose to develop a Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) that can help address one of the more persistent challenges in Earth System Science: understanding the causes for the changing atmospheric growth rate of methane. M2AF will lay the foundation for extending existing methane analysis systems beyond their current experimental states, reduce latency and cost of methane <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> analysis and improve accessibility by researchers and decision makers. To meet these needs M2AF will advance and uniquely bring together multiple observational <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets, models and analysis methods to estimate methane fluxes across three key, overlapping spatial scales in order to disentangle confounding processes: 1) global to regional scale, 2) regional to local scale, and 3) facility (point source scale). M2AF will offer workflow optimization and management tools to improve automation, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> search and discovery tools for improved access to intermediate and final products, as well as on-demand analytics and web- based tools for interacting with diverse <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> sets.

These endeavors will require the ability to precisely reconfigure satellites swarms to specifications generated on the fly according to scientific priorities. Crucial to reconfiguring swarms is the ability to maneuver individual satellites between prespecified start and end positions in a fixed amount of time.However, there is no consensus solution on how to do these single satellite maneuvers fuel-efficiently in the general case. Consider the position of a single satellite in the swarms Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) reference frame relative to the swarms reference orbit.  For specific single satellite transition scenarios, such as transferring the satellite between LVLH passive reference orbits (PROs) with minimal thrust expenditure in the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) linearized orbit dynamics system, provably optimal algorithms have been developed. But these provably optimal algorithms fail to generalize in a multitude of ways. They fail to generalize to arbitrary start and end states in the LVLH frame, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamical models such as those including J2 and drag terms, they cannot handle more detailed models of thrusters and satellite pose, and cannot account for more complex optimization criteria which balance the needs of scientific instruments with fuel efficiency and timeliness.",

        "ADOPT (abbr. Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining/ machine learning algorithm that processes large volumes of time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors.The ADOPT algorithm is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of  flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of  flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of  flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis.While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",

ALOS-2 has many acquisition modes and different wavelengths. The unique feature of one app to support all can facilitate both the users and the maintenance of the software.The software continues to contribute to the numerous applications of the InSAR technology originally developed at JPL. In particular, the L-band ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry helps geophysicists to look at the large-scale and long-term deformation rates of many tectonically active areas. Many of these areas have dense vegetation and high reliefs, and C-band InSAR <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> does not work very well, while historical InSAR <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> usually have much smaller swath coverage.

        "<p>Developers at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center have developed a software toolkit--dubbed Chapter 10 Tools--that is capable of reading <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various onboard digital recorders that follow the Range Commanders Council Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) 106 Chapter 10 Digital Recording Standard but use differing interpretations of that standard.</p><p>The toolkit reads <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files regardless of the vendor implementation of the source recorder, displays the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, and even identifies and corrects errors. Ultimately, it produces a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file that can be successfully processed post-flight.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools was developed in response to ongoing challenges researchers at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range faced when attempting to process <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files originating from various vendors' digital recorders. As Chapter 10 experienced rapid growth as a technology standard for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, many digital recorder vendors began interpreting the standard differently--resulting in errors and variations (sometimes even between one vendor's different firmware versions of the same recorder). While some errors could be identified with Chapter 10 validation software, the type of error was not always apparent, making fixes problematic. These errors and variations can prevent software from reading and processing the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file, thereby effectively making the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> unavailable.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools eliminates these challenges with a flexible software toolkit that gives users visibility into the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file's individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets, allowing for both manual and automatic correction of errors. An additional Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) editor offers the ability to modify and add details to the TMATS file. Because aircraft personnel typically only include enough information in the TMATS portion of the Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> file to allow for <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recording, this leaves a gap in ground personnel's ability to process that <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. So, the TMATS editor enables error correction and provides the ability to add the additional information needed to process the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is now in widespread use at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.</p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Diagnostic: Accurately identifies errors and variations in various Chapter 10 <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> files, as well as the error type</p><p> * Flexible: Offers a flexible architecture enabling visibility into individual <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> packets</p><p> * Easy to use: Autocorrects most errors, and makes manual error identification and correction simple and streamlined</p><p>APPLICATIONS</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is ideal for:</p><p> * NASA flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> processors needing to reconcile <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> between varying flight <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> recorders</p><p> * Software developers looking to integrate error identification and correction capabilities into their Chapter 10 toolkits</p>",

        "Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is an optical technique for measuring density gradients in flow fields, in quiescent air or even liquids. In traditional BOS, images of a speckled target are recorded using an electronic camera first at quiescent conditions (reference image) and then with the flow or density gradient causing phenomena initiated ('wind on' image). Small changes in the image of the speckled target caused by optical aberrations along the line-of-sight can be measured by cross-correlating the reference image with the 'wind on' image, yielding a map of the density gradients along the imaged path. The size of the speckles and their uniformity of illumination are critical to the success and sensitivity of the technique. BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> are recorded in real time using electronic CCD type cameras. However, processing and/or analysis of the traditional BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> is performed off-line after the test/experiment is completed.Advances in computer processing hardware enables the implementation of real-time processing and display of the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>. Two different approaches to implementing the real-time BOS (RT-BOS) processing capability have been implemented. First, a traditional multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) based approach using scheduled parallel threads is used to build a RT-BOS processing engine. In the second approach, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) approach is used to construct a RT-BOS processing engine. Generally, high-core count CPU processors can provide a useful processing rate for RT-BOS.  However, the GPU based approach exceeds the processing capability of the CPU approach, at a fraction of the cost. The GPU approach places no restrictions on the host PC processing capability, except that it be capable of acquiring the BOS image <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> from the camera in real-time.",

HDTN takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to offer substantial improvement on latency and throughput with respect to DTN implementations that exist today.  Specifically, our implementation maintains compatibility with existing implementations of DTN that conform to IETF RFC 5050, while simultaneously defining a new <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format that is better suited to higher-rate operation in many cases.  It defines and adopts a massively parallel, pipelined, and message-oriented architecture, which allows the system to scale gracefully as the resources available to the system increase.

Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle.  They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.MATLAB, MATLAB Runtime Library and ERDAS IMAGINE are required to run the software.",

Emphasis will be placed on the accuracy of parameters found in mass attenuation coefficient, fluorescence yield and line intensity databases used in quantifying geological elemental constituents. The choice of databases and values used derive from both recent experimental work and initiatives defined by fundamental parameter groups. These considerations have influenced recent upgrades made to PIQUANT. The quantification and fitting capabilities of PIQUANT in light of the upgrades will be presented. In this we display PIQUANTs ability to reproduce certificate values of glass and powder silicate standards.",

        "PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion. These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular aerospace) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models. ",

Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).Developed using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.The SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.",

        "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential to provide meaningful and reliable predictions of real-world system performance. One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance computing. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7.To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMC class and a call to the sample() method.

Generally speaking, the FEM is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, ScIFEN uses the FEM to solve the PDEs that govern the motion and deformation of solid materials under the action of external loads. Thus, ScIFEN uses input information describing a solid's geometry, material properties, applied forces, etc. to compute and return the resulting mechanical response (e.g. displacements, stresses, etc.). ScIFEN is a parallel code written in C++ and designed to scale to large problems that can be run on supercomputers across many processors. This scalability and efficiency is enabled through the utilization of several open-source high performance computing libraries. The most heavily used libraries include: 1) Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) for the parallel solution of linear/non-linear systems of equations, 2) Hierarchical <span class=\"highlight\">Data</span> Format (HDF5) for general parallel input/output, and 3) Mesh Orientated Database (MOAB) for storage and managing finite element mesh <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in parallel. ScIFEN includes several standard linear and non-linear material models including linear elastic isotropic, linear hardening plasticity, and crystal plasticity models. It supports various applied loadings including prescribed displacements and forces, surface tractions and pressures, and body forces.

        "<p>This software program offers a reliable method for calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. This innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.</p><p>Developed to calculate the number of operational life flights for B-52B pylon hooks, the program and underlying theories can be applied to estimate the service life of any critical structural component. </p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Reliable: Predicts operational flight life of critical aerostructural components</p><p> * Accurate: Considers a comprehensive suite of test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> by counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, including secondary mini-amplitude half-cycles that do not cross mean stress lines</p><p> * Customized: Identifies potential structural problem areas and calculates the number of safe flights an aerostructure can make based on its particular duty cycle</p><p> * Economical: Saves monetary costs associated with loss of expensive equipment due to component failures</p><p> * Adaptable: Offers applicability to other industries, with modifications to the input model</p><p>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</p><p> * Spacecraft</p><p> * Aircraft</p><p> * Ships</p><p> * Oil rigs</p><p> * Windmills </p><p> * Bridges</p><p> * Oscillating industrial equipment used in mines and quarries</p><p>HOW IT WORKS</p><p>The Half-Cycle Crack Growth Computer Program is a powerful and practical tool for visualizing crack growth curves associated with critical stress points. It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an aircraft can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p><p>To obtain baseline <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p><p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight. The crack growth curves provided the visual knowledge that taxiing, takeoff, drop/landing, and sometimes gusts induced a major portion of the total crack growth per operation.</p><p>Written in the C programming language, the program can be adapted for use in other industries by modifying the input model (i.e., <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> format load spectrum files) for the most expensive and mission critical components.</p><p>WHY IT IS BETTER</p><p>The program examines test <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> in a much more detailed fashion than other fatigue crack growth modeling software, counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, so it is able to make better predictions about component life. By improving fatigue and failure predictions, the software provides safer flights and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, these predictions allow engineers to determine the critical points during operation that the majority of stress is placed on a particular component, which could allow for better component design that takes those specific forces into account.</p>",

However, to model flow boiling in heated tubes, these individual correlations must be patched together to provide a continuous predictive curve of wall superheat as a function of preponderant parameters. This NTR covers the individual flow boiling correlations along with the logic and methodology for patching the correlations together to produce a single continuous boiling curve in a user-defined subroutine. In turn, the subroutine can be called by higher order lumped capacitance codes such as Thermal Desktop.",

        "Methodology and software were implemented to automatically detect Sargassum spp., a floating aquatic seaweed, in 30-meter LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. This Sargassum spp. detection is an extended form of Hus approach to derive a floating algae index (FAI), which is defined as the difference between the reflectance at the near infrared band (NIR, 859 nm) (vegetation red edge) and the linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (SWIR, 1240 or 1640 nm). The Hus algorithm was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus algorithm derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our algorithm only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid.  One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m.   To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total  number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering algorithm or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The  focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico.  The identification is followed up by a routine to map their location inside the Hybrid  Coordinate Ocean Model MODEL (HYCOM) surface grid.  This methodology, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the NASA/Applied Science and Technology Project (ASTPO), is applicable worldwide requiring only minor  changes  in the geolocation of the area of interest.",

This allows non-network cognizant operators to manage the ground gateway as though it were another piece of the ground system without perturbing its actual specifications. The HOSC has deployed their implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP) to payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). The current request is to export and make available for technology transfer the latest DTNME implementation that includes version 7.

The term modified refers to the primary modification of the core vortex-lattice methodology: the incorporation and assignment of viscous aerodynamics <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> associated with the wing section geometry to the inviscid vortex-lattice solution via iterative computational procedures. The strategy essentially converts an inviscid and purely analytic linearized method to a semi-empirical blend which retains the rapid execution speed of the linearized method while empirically characterizing the viscous aerodynamics at all spanwise lattice points. For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of aircraft design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing. The MVL-15 code is applicable to the analysis of aircraft in cruise configurations; however, it is most advantageously applied to the analysis of aircraft in various high-lift configurations.",

        "The BadhwarO'Neill (BON) model has been used for some time to describe the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment encountered in deep space by astronauts and sensitive electronics. This package contains the BON2020 model. The previous version of the model, BON2014, was calibrated to available measurements to reduce model errors for particles and energies of significance to astronaut exposure. Although subsequent studies showed the model to be reasonably accurate for such applications, modifications to the sunspot number (SSN) classification system and a large number of new highprecision measurements suggested the need to develop an improved and more capable model. The new BON2020 model relies on daily integral flux from the Advanced Composition Explorer Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/CRIS) to describe solar activity. For time periods not covered by ACE/CRIS, the updated international SSN database is used. Parameters in the new model are calibrated to available <span class=\"highlight\">data</span>, which include the new Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS02) and Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Lightnuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) highprecision measurements. It is found that the BON2020 model is a significant improvement over BON2014. Systematic bias associated with BON2014 has been removed. The average relative error of the BON2020 model compared to all available measurements is found to be <1%, and BON2020 is found to be within 15% of a large fraction of the available measurements (26,269 of 27,646  95%).",

Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points.  The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red).The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level.  These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both.A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts.

        "The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL) is a tool and open source framework that uses artificial intelligence to aid in the systematic inquiry of biology for its application to human systems. This paper defines the PeTaL concept and workflow. Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. The primary objective of this paper is to expand the domain of inquiry for human processes that seek to model those that are, were or could be found in nature with examples that relate to the field of aerospace and to spur development of tools that can work together to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. Specifically specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology are proposed in conjunction with artificial evolution. Blockchain technology may be vital in allowing open source design tools such as PeTaL to democratize design and yet protect intellectual property. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem. Tools include text classification, thesaurus, <span class=\"highlight\">data</span> visualization, and analysis. Applications of PeTaL include guiding human space exploration, understanding human and geological history, and discovering new or extinct life.",
