Through our collective exposure to remote-sensing based methane research and applied science we assess that currently there is no information system technology that can address the improvements in data analysis latency, discoverability, data fusion and on-demand analytics required by the research community and public and private sector decision makers. We propose to develop a Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) that can help address one of the more persistent challenges in Earth System Science: understanding the causes for the changing atmospheric growth rate of methane. M2AF will lay the foundation for extending existing methane analysis systems beyond their current experimental states, reduce latency and cost of methane data analysis and improve accessibility by researchers and decision makers. To meet these needs M2AF will advance and uniquely bring together multiple observational data sets, models and analysis methods to estimate methane fluxes across three key, overlapping spatial scales in order to disentangle confounding processes: 1) global to regional scale, 2) regional to local scale, and 3) facility (point source scale).

629ee4c51c48105c3a182c23,NPO-50934-1,JPL,Data driven solutions for general satellite maneuvers.,"Satellite swarms will be an integral tool for many future space-based scientific endeavors, including space-based interferometry. These endeavors will require the ability to precisely reconfigure satellites swarms to specifications generated on the fly according to scientific priorities. Crucial to reconfiguring swarms is the ability to maneuver individual satellites between prespecified start and end positions in a fixed amount of time.However, there is no consensus solution on how to do these single satellite maneuvers fuel-efficiently in the general case. Consider the position of a single satellite in the swarms Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) reference frame relative to the swarms reference orbit. For specific single satellite transition scenarios, such as transferring the satellite between LVLH passive reference orbits (PROs) with minimal thrust expenditure in the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) linearized orbit dynamics system, provably optimal algorithms have been developed. But these provably optimal algorithms fail to generalize in a multitude of ways. They fail to generalize to arbitrary start and end states in the LVLH frame, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamical models such as those including J2 and drag terms, they cannot handle more detailed models of thrusters and satellite pose, and cannot account for more complex optimization criteria which balance the needs of scientific instruments with fuel efficiency and timeliness.",data and image processing,Open Source,NA,https://github.com/marsai2/swarm-spacecraft-formation-flying,NA,2024-07-16

5e196ddc40205c0ba82664e2,ARC-18198-1,ARC,Automatic Discovery of Precursors in Time Series Data (ADOPT) code release,"ADOPT (abbr. Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a data mining/ machine learning algorithm that processes large volumes of time series data and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical data to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's data mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series data, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of data, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors.The ADOPT algorithm is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series data. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the data. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis.While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",aeronautics,Open Source,NA,https://github.com/nasa/ADOPT,NA,2024-07-16

Many of these areas have dense vegetation and high reliefs, and C-band InSAR data does not work very well, while historical InSAR data usually have much smaller swath coverage. In addition, large-scale deformation of large earthquakes can also be measured with higher quality with L-band ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry.

Ultimately, it produces a data file that can be successfully processed post-flight.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools was developed in response to ongoing challenges researchers at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range faced when attempting to process data files originating from various vendors' digital recorders. As Chapter 10 experienced rapid growth as a technology standard for data recording, many digital recorder vendors began interpreting the standard differently--resulting in errors and variations (sometimes even between one vendor's different firmware versions of the same recorder). While some errors could be identified with Chapter 10 validation software, the type of error was not always apparent, making fixes problematic. These errors and variations can prevent software from reading and processing the data file, thereby effectively making the data unavailable.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools eliminates these challenges with a flexible software toolkit that gives users visibility into the data file's individual data packets, allowing for both manual and automatic correction of errors. An additional Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard (TMATS) editor offers the ability to modify and add details to the TMATS file. Because aircraft personnel typically only include enough information in the TMATS portion of the Chapter 10 data file to allow for data recording, this leaves a gap in ground personnel's ability to process that data. So, the TMATS editor enables error correction and provides the ability to add the additional information needed to process the data.</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is now in widespread use at Armstrong's Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.</p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Diagnostic: Accurately identifies errors and variations in various Chapter 10 data files, as well as the error type</p><p> * Flexible: Offers a flexible architecture enabling visibility into individual data packets</p><p> * Easy to use: Autocorrects most errors, and makes manual error identification and correction simple and streamlined</p><p>APPLICATIONS</p><p>Chapter 10 Tools is ideal for:</p><p> * NASA flight data processors needing to reconcile data between varying flight data recorders</p><p> * Software developers looking to integrate error identification and correction capabilities into their Chapter 10 toolkits</p>",data and image processing,General Public Release,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16

This technique uses transfer learning from classification models that were pretrained on the massive microscopy image database from the NASA ASG lab. Experiments show that transferring the features learned from pretraining on large microscopy datasets to segmentation tasks leads to accurate segmentation models with significantly less training data and the models generalize to unseen data better. This is significant because training data for segmentation tasks is expensive and in limited availability and this technique reduces the required training data. In addition, the labeled training data cannot account for all possible imaging and sample conditions that the model should be expected to perform accurately on, and experiments showed that this technique improves model accuracy on data outside the training distribution.

62623fc171dfdb28a26d3462,LEW-20407-1,GRC,"Real-Time Background Oriented Schlieren Software Package Update, 2022","Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is an optical technique for measuring density gradients in flow fields, in quiescent air or even liquids. In traditional BOS, images of a speckled target are recorded using an electronic camera first at quiescent conditions (reference image) and then with the flow or density gradient causing phenomena initiated ('wind on' image). Small changes in the image of the speckled target caused by optical aberrations along the line-of-sight can be measured by cross-correlating the reference image with the 'wind on' image, yielding a map of the density gradients along the imaged path. The size of the speckles and their uniformity of illumination are critical to the success and sensitivity of the technique. BOS image data are recorded in real time using electronic CCD type cameras. However, processing and/or analysis of the traditional BOS image data is performed off-line after the test/experiment is completed.Advances in computer processing hardware enables the implementation of real-time processing and display of the BOS image data. Two different approaches to implementing the real-time BOS (RT-BOS) processing capability have been implemented. First, a traditional multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) based approach using scheduled parallel threads is used to build a RT-BOS processing engine. In the second approach, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) approach is used to construct a RT-BOS processing engine. Generally, high-core count CPU processors can provide a useful processing rate for RT-BOS. However, the GPU based approach exceeds the processing capability of the CPU approach, at a fraction of the cost. The GPU approach places no restrictions on the host PC processing capability, except that it be capable of acquiring the BOS image data from the camera in real-time.",aeronautics,U.S. Release Only,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16

This has left existing craft unable to utilize more than a small fraction of available capacity. Further, to date, most known implementations of DTN have been designed to operate on the spacecraft themselves.The innovation, in this case, is a software prototype called High-speed DTN (or HDTN). HDTN takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to offer substantial improvement on latency and throughput with respect to DTN implementations that exist today. Specifically, our implementation maintains compatibility with existing implementations of DTN that conform to IETF RFC 5050, while simultaneously defining a new data format that is better suited to higher-rate operation in many cases. It defines and adopts a massively parallel, pipelined, and message-oriented architecture, which allows the system to scale gracefully as the resources available to the system increase.

For a given year, the PPET software package takes in temporally processed vegetation index data (3-D spatio-temporal arrays) generated by the Time Series Product Tool (TSPT) and outputs spatial grids (2-D arrays) of vegetation phenological parameters. As a precursor to PPET, the TSPT uses quality information for each pixel of each date to remove bad or suspect data, and then interpolates and digitally filters the time series to produce a continuous, smoothed vegetation index product in which data voids are eliminated. Both the TSPT and PPET use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite multi-spectral data as a default, but each software package is easily modifiable and could be used with any high-temporal-rate remote sensing system that is capable of producing vegetation indices.Unlike other known plant phenological parameter estimation software, the PPET produces not only common phenological parameters but also real-time and custom parameters without a priori assumptions about the shape of the phenological cycle. Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle. They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.MATLAB, MATLAB Runtime Library and ERDAS IMAGINE are required to run the software.",environmental science earth air space exoplanet,U.S. Government Purpose Release,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16

Emphasis will be placed on the accuracy of parameters found in mass attenuation coefficient, fluorescence yield and line intensity databases used in quantifying geological elemental constituents. The choice of databases and values used derive from both recent experimental work and initiatives defined by fundamental parameter groups. These considerations have influenced recent upgrades made to PIQUANT. The quantification and fitting capabilities of PIQUANT in light of the upgrades will be presented. In this we display PIQUANTs ability to reproduce certificate values of glass and powder silicate standards.",data and image processing,General Public Release,https://zenodo.org/record/6959126#.YvrZpnbMJPY,NA,NA,2024-07-16
66751243a03378aeee02aa12,LEW-19687-1,GRC,Weight Analysis of Turbine Engine - an Object-Oriented Version (WATE++),"WATE++ is an object-oriented computer code for gas turbine engine weight estimation; it calculates the weight and dimension of each major gas turbine engine component. It is used to create engine architecture that could achieve an engine thermodynamic cycle produced by a thermodynamic cycle code. The thermodynamic cycle data, the material properties, and design rules for geometric, stress, and turbo-machinery stage-loading limits were used to determine an acceptable engine flowpath and weight.The code was converted from the structured FORTRAN version of the code, originally developed by Boeing Aircraft for NASA, to improve its maintainability and extensibility. The conversion was done within the NASAs NPSS (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation) framework. This enables WATE to interact seamlessly with the thermodynamic cycle model which provides component flow data such as airflows, temperatures, and pressures, etc. that are also required for sizing the components and weight calculations. The tight integration between the NPSS and WATE++ greatly enhances system-level analysis and optimization capabilities. ",design and integration tools,U.S. Release Only,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16
5ed1f1c140205c10076166d4,GSC-18322-1,GSFC,"Heat Analysis Manager (HAM), a Thermal Desktop API Based Heat Map Generation Software","Thermal engineers often create custom heat maps to analyze their thermal models. However, generating a heat map is difficult because thermal simulations only readily provide certain attributes of simulated nodes, such as temperature, capacitance, and heat generation, along with a network of conductances. Heat flow values are quantities derived from these nodal attributes, and the difficulty in data processing and management of heat flow between nodes quickly grows as node count increases for large models. Deriving a network of heat flow values requires a vast amount of calculations and data handling, and the heat map generation process generally suffers from processing speed, loss of accuracy, and/or presentation of data in a clear and concise format. Heat Analysis Manager (HAM) is a Thermal Desktop (TD) based free multi-purpose tool developed to aid thermal engineers in analyzing thermal models which includes a heat map generation utility.

5d8ef25040205c0375317633,ARC-17644-1,ARC,PSYCO: A Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning environment ,"PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion. These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few data types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular aerospace) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: data invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and data aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models.

SRVT automatically identifies high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed.

One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance computing. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7.To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides data to be used for calibration.

Thus, ScIFEN uses input information describing a solid's geometry, material properties, applied forces, etc. to compute and return the resulting mechanical response (e.g. displacements, stresses, etc.). ScIFEN is a parallel code written in C++ and designed to scale to large problems that can be run on supercomputers across many processors.

This innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.</p><p>Developed to calculate the number of operational life flights for B-52B pylon hooks, the program and underlying theories can be applied to estimate the service life of any critical structural component. </p><p>BENEFITS</p><p> * Reliable: Predicts operational flight life of critical aerostructural components</p><p> * Accurate: Considers a comprehensive suite of test data by counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, including secondary mini-amplitude half-cycles that do not cross mean stress lines</p><p> * Customized: Identifies potential structural problem areas and calculates the number of safe flights an aerostructure can make based on its particular duty cycle</p><p> * Economical: Saves monetary costs associated with loss of expensive equipment due to component failures</p><p> * Adaptable: Offers applicability to other industries, with modifications to the input model</p><p>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</p><p> * Spacecraft</p><p> * Aircraft</p><p> * Ships</p><p> * Oil rigs</p><p> * Windmills </p><p> * Bridges</p><p> * Oscillating industrial equipment used in mines and quarries</p><p>HOW IT WORKS</p><p>The Half-Cycle Crack Growth Computer Program is a powerful and practical tool for visualizing crack growth curves associated with critical stress points. It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an aircraft can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p><p>To obtain baseline data for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the data and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p><p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight. The crack growth curves provided the visual knowledge that taxiing, takeoff, drop/landing, and sometimes gusts induced a major portion of the total crack growth per operation.</p><p>Written in the C programming language, the program can be adapted for use in other industries by modifying the input model (i.e., data format load spectrum files) for the most expensive and mission critical components.</p><p>WHY IT IS BETTER</p><p>The program examines test data in a much more detailed fashion than other fatigue crack growth modeling software, counting every half-cycle of each random loading spectrum, so it is able to make better predictions about component life. By improving fatigue and failure predictions, the software provides safer flights and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, these predictions allow engineers to determine the critical points during operation that the majority of stress is placed on a particular component, which could allow for better component design that takes those specific forces into account.</p>",structures and mechanisms,General Public Release,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16

The governing equations that are employed include allowances for both chemical and thermal non-equilibrium processes, coupled with a wide variety of turbulence models for both Reynolds-averaged and large eddy simulations. The software package can simulate two-dimensional, axisymmetric, or three-dimensional problems on structured multi-block meshes or unstructured meshes. It also allows one to invoke a parabolic (i.e. space-marching) treatment for any subset of a problem that can accommodate this solution strategy. VULCAN-CFD provides a significant level of geometric flexibility for structured grid simulations by allowing for arbitrary face-to-face C(0) continuous and non-C(0) continuous block interface connectivities. The unstructured grid paradigm allows for mixed element unstructured meshes that contain any combination of tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramid, and hexahedral cell elements.

LAMP will process sensor inputs, such as lidar scans, IMU, and odometry estimates, and produce an accurate global location, global map and global pose-graph. This capability is also extended to multi-robots systems, through a centralized fusion of pose-graphs, with low data-rate communications of sparse pose-graph information.The lidar-odometry front-end can be leveraged as part of LAMP, or separately, to produce an accurate odometry estimate, by processing lidar scans, along with IMU and other, less accurate, odometry estimates. LAMP is designed to be a modular architecture and can have modules adapted to include different information into the global pose-graph, to leverage what sensing information is available for maximum localization accuracy.

This NTR focuses on modeling and development of new code infrastructure of steady state flow boiling through the transfer line that connects a propellant tank to an engine or customer receiver tank, which is required to set limits on the allowable heat flux into the line. Using the largest ever collection of available cryogenic heated tube data, universal cryogenic flow boiling correlations were recently developed for various regimes of the boiling curve. However, to model flow boiling in heated tubes, these individual correlations must be patched together to provide a continuous predictive curve of wall superheat as a function of preponderant parameters. This NTR covers the individual flow boiling correlations along with the logic and methodology for patching the correlations together to produce a single continuous boiling curve in a user-defined subroutine. In turn, the subroutine can be called by higher order lumped capacitance codes such as Thermal Desktop.",propulsion,U.S. Release Only,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16
59816620960002ef53059a7d,SSC-00505,SSC,Algorithm for Automated Sargassum Detection for Landsat-8 OLI Imagery,"Methodology and software were implemented to automatically detect Sargassum spp., a floating aquatic seaweed, in 30-meter LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. This Sargassum spp. detection is an extended form of Hus approach to derive a floating algae index (FAI), which is defined as the difference between the reflectance at the near infrared band (NIR, 859 nm) (vegetation red edge) and the linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (SWIR, 1240 or 1640 nm). The Hus algorithm was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus algorithm derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our algorithm only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid. One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m. To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering algorithm or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible data of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico. The identification is followed up by a routine to map their location inside the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model MODEL (HYCOM) surface grid. This methodology, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the NASA/Applied Science and Technology Project (ASTPO), is applicable worldwide requiring only minor changes in the geolocation of the area of interest.",environmental science earth air space exoplanet,General Public Release,NA,NA,NA,2024-07-16

5b7e4929960002fa62038633,LAR-18774-1,LARC,MVL-15 (Modified Vortex Lattice),"MVL-15 is a Modified Vortex-Lattice (MVL) aerodynamics analysis code. The term modified refers to the primary modification of the core vortex-lattice methodology: the incorporation and assignment of viscous aerodynamics data associated with the wing section geometry to the inviscid vortex-lattice solution via iterative computational procedures. The strategy essentially converts an inviscid and purely analytic linearized method to a semi-empirical blend which retains the rapid execution speed of the linearized method while empirically characterizing the viscous aerodynamics at all spanwise lattice points. For the analysis of airplane configurations consisting of more than one wing, the resulting spanwise section aerodynamics can be integrated to determine the aerodynamics of each wing, both separately and combined. As implemented, the methodology inherently provides the capability to determine the non-linear viscous effects on lift and drag at relatively high angles of attack, to identify the maximum lift coefficient, and to characterize the onset of stall. Furthermore, the methodology provides the capability to determine the lift and drag associated with the application of aircraft design strategies for lift augmentation such as the use of flaps or blowing. The MVL-15 code is applicable to the analysis of aircraft in cruise configurations; however, it is most advantageously applied to the analysis of aircraft in various high-lift configurations.",aeronautics,U.S. Release Only,NA,NA,Written in FORTRAN-90,2024-07-16

The system will typically be a software system that has been instrumented to generate events as it executes. The event stream is then consumed by the DejaVu monitor, and checked against a formal specification. If the event stream violates the specification, an error message is generated. This technology can be used in two ways: online and offline. In the online case, it runs on board for example a rover as it operates, checking that what is happening on the rover is according to expectations formalized in the formal logic. If the expectations are not met, the DejaVu monitor will inform the software that it needs to correct behavior. Alternatively, DejaVu can be used to analyze log files produced by the monitored system. Such log files can be analyzed after the system has executed.Software program for analyzing execution traces generated by a running system, typically another program, here referred to as the Monitored System (MS).

This package contains the BON2020 model. The previous version of the model, BON2014, was calibrated to available measurements to reduce model errors for particles and energies of significance to astronaut exposure. Although subsequent studies showed the model to be reasonably accurate for such applications, modifications to the sunspot number (SSN) classification system and a large number of new highprecision measurements suggested the need to develop an improved and more capable model. The new BON2020 model relies on daily integral flux from the Advanced Composition Explorer Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (ACE/CRIS) to describe solar activity. For time periods not covered by ACE/CRIS, the updated international SSN database is used. Parameters in the new model are calibrated to available data, which include the new Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS02) and Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Lightnuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) highprecision measurements. It is found that the BON2020 model is a significant improvement over BON2014. Systematic bias associated with BON2014 has been removed. The average relative error of the BON2020 model compared to all available measurements is found to be <1%, and BON2020 is found to be within 15% of a large fraction of the available measurements (26,269 of 27,646 95%).",environmental science earth air space exoplanet,General Public Release,NA,NA,Secure email from Repository for software download,2024-07-16

The first one extracts average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years). Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red).The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level. These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both.A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts.

This paper defines the PeTaL concept and workflow. Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. The primary objective of this paper is to expand the domain of inquiry for human processes that seek to model those that are, were or could be found in nature with examples that relate to the field of aerospace and to spur development of tools that can work together to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. Specifically specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology are proposed in conjunction with artificial evolution. Blockchain technology may be vital in allowing open source design tools such as PeTaL to democratize design and yet protect intellectual property. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem.
